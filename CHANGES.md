# Changelog

## v1.8.6 — 2026-04-26

### Added

**SMTP / email notifications.** Email is now a sibling channel to webhooks
— same events, same maintenance-window suppression, same per-event toggles.
The Notifications tab gains an SMTP section: host, port, TLS mode
(STARTTLS / implicit TLS / plain), From address, optional auth, optional
HELO override, recipients list, and a "Send test email" button with
optional override recipient.

The per-event toggle table now has two columns: **Webhook** (existing,
opt-out) and **Email** (new, opt-in per event). Email is opt-in because
nobody wants every device-online event to land in their inbox.

Three TLS modes:
- `starttls` (port 587) — modern default, STARTTLS upgrade after EHLO
- `tls` (port 465) — implicit TLS, the older "SMTPS" port
- `plain` (port 25) — no TLS; only safe to localhost or trusted relays

Auth is optional. Empty username = no AUTH attempted (useful for localhost
relays that allow anonymous submission). Passwords are stored in
`config.json` and masked in `GET /api/config` responses (the UI just sees
a `smtp_password_set: true` flag).

**LDAP / LDAPS authentication.** External auth source for login. Local
users in `users.json` are tried first — emergency local admin always works
even if LDAP is down. Users authenticated via LDAP are auto-provisioned
into `users.json` with the role determined by group membership.

Configuration in the Security tab:
- LDAP URL (`ldaps://` or `ldap://`)
- TLS verification toggle (set to off only for self-signed CAs in dev)
- Service account DN + password (used for the search step; the user's
  own credentials verify the password in a second bind)
- User search base + filter — `(uid={u})` for OpenLDAP/FreeIPA,
  `(sAMAccountName={u})` for AD
- **Required group DN** — empty allows any user with valid creds; set
  this to lock login to a specific group
- **Admin group DN** — members get the `admin` role on login; everyone
  else gets `viewer`. Auto-promotes existing local users on next LDAP
  login but never auto-demotes.
- Two test buttons: "Test connection" (verifies the service account
  bind) and "Test user login" (full auth path with a real username/password
  pair, doesn't create a session)

Library: **ldap3** (pure Python). The module imports lazily, so servers
that don't enable LDAP don't need the library installed at all. To
install: `pip3 install ldap3` (Fedora: `dnf install python3-ldap3`).

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/smtp/test` | Send a test email; optional `{"recipient": "..."}` override |
| POST | `/api/ldap/test` | Verify service-account bind (URL/TLS/creds). Body fields override config for "test before save" UX. |
| POST | `/api/ldap/test-user` | Run the full auth path for one user. Returns DN, role, full name, email. |

### New config keys

| Key | Type | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `smtp_enabled` | bool | Master toggle for email channel |
| `smtp_host` / `smtp_port` / `smtp_tls` | string / int / enum | Server config |
| `smtp_from` | string | From address (must contain `@`) |
| `smtp_username` / `smtp_password` | string | Optional AUTH; password masked on GET |
| `smtp_helo_name` | string | Override HELO/EHLO hostname |
| `smtp_recipients` | string | Comma/semicolon/whitespace-separated list |
| `email_events` | dict | `{event_name: bool}` per-event opt-in |
| `ldap_enabled` | bool | Master toggle |
| `ldap_url` | string | `ldaps://...` or `ldap://...` |
| `ldap_bind_dn` / `ldap_bind_password` | string | Service account creds |
| `ldap_user_base` | string | Search base |
| `ldap_user_filter` | string | Must contain `{u}` |
| `ldap_required_group` / `ldap_admin_group` | string | Group DNs |
| `ldap_tls_verify` | bool | Default true |
| `ldap_timeout` | int | Seconds, 1–60, default 5 |

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.8.6
- `fire_webhook()` is now a single dispatch point — runs the shared gates
  once, then fans out to webhook AND email channels in turn. The hard
  rename was avoided because of dozens of call sites; the function still
  has the historical name.
- `handle_login` gains an LDAP fallback path. Tried only when local auth
  fails; LdapTransientError logs to audit but presents as plain
  invalid-credentials to the client (no info leak about whether LDAP is
  reachable).
- Auto-provisioned LDAP users get a placeholder `password_hash` that
  never matches anything. Subsequent local-auth attempts fail and fall
  through to LDAP again — there's no way to "downgrade" an LDAP user
  to local-only by accident.
- `users.json` entries gain optional `ldap_dn`, `ldap_full_name`,
  `ldap_email` fields when created via LDAP.

### Tests

30 new tests in `tests/test_v186.py`:
- SMTP: recipients parser (5 cases), per-event email toggle (5 cases),
  input validation (5 cases), email render (2 cases)
- LDAP: filter escaping (2 cases), authenticate() success/failure paths
  (5 cases) using a fake `ldap3` module installed in `sys.modules`,
  required-group enforcement, role mapping
- Wiring + version checks (3 cases)

**Full suite: 212 passing, 0 failing** (1 pre-existing skip).

### Notes

- LDAP requires the `ldap3` library on the server. Empty config + disabled
  toggle is the default, so no library needed unless you turn it on.
  Server emits `LdapTransientError: ldap3 library not installed` if
  enabled without the library — surfaces in the audit log.
- SMTP works with any RFC 5321 server. Tested mentally against Postfix,
  AWS SES, Gmail, Mailgun, Sendgrid, ProtonMail Bridge.
- Email recipients are a flat fleet-wide list (everyone gets every
  enabled event). Per-user opt-in is not a v1.8.6 feature; could happen
  in 1.9.0 if anyone asks.
- The "Test user login" button in the LDAP section is admin-only and
  doesn't create a session — it just runs `authenticate()` against the
  current config and shows what would happen. Useful for verifying the
  filter/group config without making the user log out.
- Enabling LDAP doesn't disable local auth. There's no "LDAP-only" mode
  by design — if LDAP breaks, you can still log in as a local emergency
  admin and fix it.

### Compatibility

- v1.8.5 servers work with v1.8.6 clients (everything's additive).
- v1.8.5 → v1.8.6 needs no migration. SMTP and LDAP are off by default;
  saving Settings once writes the new keys with their defaults.
- Agent binary unchanged from v1.8.5 except for the version string.

## v1.8.5 — 2026-04-26

### Fixed

**"Remember me" actually remembers now.** v1.8.4 introduced the checkbox and
the per-token TTL on the server side, but the client always saved the token
to `sessionStorage` — which by definition is wiped when the browser closes.
The 30-day server-side TTL was correct; the browser was just throwing away
the token at the end of every tab session. Particularly visible if you have
2FA enabled because every reload meant another full login dance.

The fix:

- When "remember me" is checked, the token + username are saved to
  **`localStorage`** (persists across browser restarts).
- When unchecked, they go to **`sessionStorage`** as before (cleared with
  the tab — explicit "this is a kiosk / public computer" semantics).
- `getToken()` now reads from both stores, preferring localStorage.
- `getMe()` (new helper) does the same for the username display.
- `checkAuth()` (called on page load) uses `getToken()` instead of reading
  sessionStorage directly — which was the actual bug that made remember-me
  a no-op for users with 2FA.
- `doLogout()` clears both stores so toggling between modes doesn't leave
  stale credentials behind.
- Login flow clears both stores before writing the new token, preventing
  any cross-mode contamination if the user toggles the checkbox.

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.8.5
- No server-side or agent changes — this is a pure client-side bug fix
- No data file changes; existing tokens keep working

### Tests

182 passing, 0 failing (1 pre-existing skip). No new tests; this is a
DOM-only behavior fix that's easier to verify by hand than to mock in
unittest. To verify after deploy:

1. Tick "Remember me", log in, complete 2FA
2. Close the browser entirely (not just the tab)
3. Reopen, navigate to the dashboard URL → should land on the app, not
   the login page

If you uncheck "Remember me" and repeat, the second visit should bounce
you to login as expected (sessionStorage was cleared with the browser).

### Notes

- This is purely a client bug. v1.8.4 servers work fine with v1.8.5
  clients and vice versa. The agent binary is byte-identical apart from
  its version string.
- If you've been logging in with 2FA repeatedly because remember-me
  seemed broken — sorry, that's on me. Should work now.

---

## v1.8.4 — 2026-04-25

### Added

**Settings page reorganized into 4 tabs.** The flat scrolling list was getting
out of hand. New tabs: **General**, **Notifications**, **Security**, **Advanced**.
URL hash drives tab selection so you can bookmark `#settings/security` etc.

**Server identity** (`server_name`). Display name shown in:
- Browser title (`<title>`)
- Login page header
- Webhook payloads (as `_server_name`)
- Push notifications (consumers can render it however they like)

**Default poll interval** for new agent enrollments. Was hardcoded to 60s; now
configurable in 10–3600s range from the General tab. Existing devices keep
their per-device poll interval — change individual devices from their detail
page.

**Online TTL** (when a device is considered offline). Was hardcoded `ONLINE_TTL = 180`;
now a config value with a 90-second floor (`MIN_ONLINE_TTL`) to prevent
configurations where devices would flap between polls.

**CVE details cache TTL** (`cve_cache_days`, default 7). Was hardcoded in
`cve_scanner.py`; now passed from the server config to `scan_device()`.

**Per-event webhook toggles.** Replaces the four legacy boolean flags
(`offline_webhook_enabled`, `monitor_webhook_enabled`, `cve_webhook_enabled`,
`service_webhook_enabled`) with a single `webhook_events` dict listing all
11 event types individually:

- `device_offline`, `device_online`
- `monitor_down`, `monitor_up`
- `patch_alert` (with embedded threshold input on the same row)
- `cve_found` (with severity-filter checkboxes for which severities fire)
- `service_down`, `service_up`
- `log_alert`
- `command_queued`, `command_executed`

Disabled events get logged to the webhook log as `"disabled"` so you can see
what was suppressed.

**CVE severity filter.** `cve_found` webhooks previously fired on critical/high
hardcoded; now you choose which severities fire from
`{critical, high, medium, low, unknown}`. Default unchanged.

**Remember-me on the login page.** Tickbox below password field. Two session
TTLs: short (default 24h, used when unchecked) and long (default 30 days,
used when checked). Both configurable from Security tab. Server-side
admin can pre-tick the box via `remember_me_default`.

Tokens now carry their own TTL in `tokens.json`, so a long session created
with "remember me" doesn't get pruned by the cleanup of short tokens.
Legacy tokens without a TTL field fall back to the old global `TOKEN_TTL`.

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/public-info` | Unauthenticated. Returns `server_name`, `server_version`, `remember_me_default` for the login page |

### New config keys

| Key | Type | Default | Where |
|-----|------|---------|-------|
| `server_name` | string | `""` (renders as "RemotePower") | General |
| `default_poll_interval` | int (seconds) | 60 | General |
| `online_ttl` | int (seconds) | 180 (min 90) | General |
| `cve_cache_days` | int | 7 (1–90) | General |
| `webhook_events` | dict[str, bool] | all true | Notifications |
| `cve_severity_filter` | list[string] | `["critical", "high"]` | Notifications |
| `session_ttl_short` | int (seconds) | 86400 | Security |
| `session_ttl_long` | int (seconds) | 86400 × 30 | Security |
| `remember_me_default` | bool | false | Security |

### Backward compatibility

All four legacy webhook toggle keys (`offline_webhook_enabled`,
`monitor_webhook_enabled`, `cve_webhook_enabled`, `service_webhook_enabled`)
still work as fallbacks when `webhook_events` is not set. When `webhook_events`
is present, it takes precedence. UI saves to the new key from now on, so
upgrades from 1.8.3 are seamless on first save.

The `cve_found` webhook used a hardcoded `('critical', 'high')` allowlist
inside `_detect_new_cve_and_fire_webhook`; this is now driven by
`get_cve_severity_filter()`. Existing servers without the config key get
the same behavior they had before.

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.8.4
- `ONLINE_TTL` (module constant) → `get_online_ttl()` helper. The constant
  `DEFAULT_ONLINE_TTL` still exists for tests.
- `_detect_new_cve_and_fire_webhook()` now respects `webhook_events.cve_found`
  and uses `get_cve_severity_filter()` for severity.
- `fire_webhook()` runs every event through `is_webhook_event_enabled()` and
  applies severity filtering for `cve_found`. Suppressed events are logged
  as `"disabled"` or `"filtered"` for observability.
- `handle_login` reads `remember_me` from the body and stores per-token TTL.
- `verify_token` and `cleanup_tokens` honor `entry['ttl']` per token,
  falling back to `TOKEN_TTL` for legacy tokens.

### Tests

34 new tests in `tests/test_v184.py` covering:
- All 8 config helpers (defaults, explicit values, clamping)
- Legacy → new webhook key migration
- CVE severity filter validation
- Per-token TTL semantics + legacy token fallback
- WEBHOOK_EVENTS contract (event set + entry shape)

`tests/test_api.py` updated to use `DEFAULT_ONLINE_TTL` instead of removed
`ONLINE_TTL` constant. New regression test for the helper clamping behavior.

**Full suite: 182 passing, 0 failing** (1 pre-existing skip).

### Notes

- Going from 1.8.3 → 1.8.4 needs no data migration. Settings open with
  defaults; saving once writes the new keys.
- The Settings tabs preserve URL hash so `https://server/#settings/security`
  jumps straight to the right tab.
- "Remember me" extends the session lifetime on the server side; it does
  *not* persist credentials anywhere on the client. Logging out still
  invalidates the token immediately.

---

## v1.8.3 — 2026-04-25

### Fixed

**SSH/sshd alias resolution.** On Debian/Ubuntu, the SSH unit is named
`ssh.service` and `sshd.service` is just an alias. `journalctl` does NOT
follow systemd unit aliases, so users who typed the RHEL-style
`sshd.service` in their watched-services list got zero log lines forever
even though state checks worked fine.

- Agent: new `_resolve_unit_alias()` helper queries `systemctl show
  <unit> --property=Id` to get the canonical name, then runs
  `journalctl -u <canonical>` instead. Falls through silently to the
  original name on any error.
- `get_services()` now also returns the canonical name in the heartbeat
  payload (under `canonical` key), so the UI can show "sshd.service →
  ssh.service" if you ever want to surface the resolution.
- No data-format breakage; no config changes needed. Existing installs
  with `sshd.service` watched on Debian will start receiving logs after
  the agent self-update.

### Added

**Calendar — shared events page.** Standalone shared calendar at
`/api/calendar`. Fully shared across all users; any authenticated user
can create/edit/delete events. Designed to live next to the existing
Schedule page (which is for cron-driven device commands), not replace it.

- Month-grid view, click a day to create an event, click an event pill
  to edit. Events span across days; days with more than 3 events show
  a "+N more" indicator.
- 7-color palette (blue/green/amber/red/purple/teal/slate). Server
  validates against an explicit allowlist — passing an unknown color
  silently falls back to blue.
- Events have title, optional description, ISO-8601 start (required) and
  end (defaults to start), all-day flag, and color.
- New endpoints:
  - `GET /api/calendar?from=<iso>&to=<iso>` — list events overlapping the range
  - `POST /api/calendar` — create
  - `PUT /api/calendar/{id}` — update
  - `DELETE /api/calendar/{id}` — remove
- Capped at 1000 events per server (`MAX_CALENDAR_EVENTS`).

**Tasks — shared kanban board.** Four states (upcoming / ongoing /
pending / closed). Fully shared with no per-user assignment.

- Drag-and-drop between columns to change state. Optimistic update;
  resyncs from server on failure.
- Optional device linking: every task can be tied to one device or none.
  Device chip shown on the card; filter dropdown on the page narrows
  the board to one device's tasks (or "no device linked").
- Click a task to expand/edit; "+ New task" button.
- New endpoints:
  - `GET /api/tasks?state=<s>&device=<id>` — list with optional filters
  - `POST /api/tasks` — create
  - `PUT /api/tasks/{id}` — update (partial; can be just `{state: 'closed'}`)
  - `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}` — remove
- Capped at 500 tasks per server (`MAX_TASKS`).

### New data files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `calendar.json` | Shared calendar events |
| `tasks.json` | Shared task board |

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.8.3
- Agent `get_services()` payload may include a `canonical` key per service
  if the user-supplied unit name was an alias
- Sidebar navigation: new "Calendar" and "Tasks" entries between
  Schedule and the Tools section divider

### Tests

24 new tests in `tests/test_v183.py`:
- Calendar: 8 cases for event validation (color clamping, end-after-start,
  required fields, full palette acceptance)
- Tasks: 9 cases for task validation (state allowlist, partial updates,
  device-id resolution, unlink semantics)
- Agent: 3 cases for `_resolve_unit_alias` with mocked systemctl
- Constants and handlers: 4 wiring checks

Loosened the version assertion in `test_v182.py` from exact-match to
`>= 1.8.2` (same pattern as `test_v181.py`) so the test doesn't break
on every patch bump.

**Full suite: 147 passing, 0 failing** (1 pre-existing skip).

### Notes

- The calendar is intentionally separate from Maintenance and Schedule.
  Maintenance windows suppress webhooks; Schedule drives device commands;
  Calendar is just a shared notepad for "what's happening when". Mixing
  them would be a different design.
- Tasks have no due dates by design — if you need a due date, create a
  calendar event with the same title. The two compose naturally.
- Device linking on tasks is one-to-one (a task has one device or none).
  If you need a task that touches multiple devices, link it to none and
  mention them in the description.
- Both features use the standard X-Token auth (no special role required
  for create/edit/delete). If you want admin-only mutations, add
  `require_admin_auth()` to the handlers — small change.

---

## v1.8.2 — 2026-04-24

### Fixed

**Log tail bug: quiet devices invisible on the Logs page.** In v1.8.0/1.8.1,
the agent silently skipped a unit if `journalctl` returned no recent lines,
and the whole submission was skipped if every watched unit was quiet. Result:
a device with watched services but a calm workload (e.g. sshd on an idle
box, nginx with no traffic) never created an entry in `log_watch.json` and
was indistinguishable from a device not running the agent at all.

- Agent now always includes every watched unit in the submission, with an
  empty list if the unit was quiet
- Agent now always POSTs when it has watched units, even if all are empty
- Server preserves the unit key with an empty array, so the device appears
  on the Logs page as "watched, quiet in this window" rather than absent
- Live tail empty-state now diagnoses the three distinct cases:
  "no devices submitting", "devices reporting but quiet", and "current
  filter matches nothing"

### Added

**Fleet-wide log alert rules** — rules that apply across the whole fleet,
complementing the existing per-device rules from v1.8.0.

- New `log_rules_global.json` storage; new endpoints
  `GET/POST /api/logs/rules/global` and `DELETE /api/logs/rules/global/{id}`
- Wildcard unit: setting `unit="*"` matches any unit on any device (useful
  for catch-all patterns like `OOMkilled`). Specific unit name matches all
  devices running that unit.
- `handle_log_submit` now evaluates both per-device and fleet-wide rules
  against incoming lines. Each `(scope, unit, pattern)` fires at most once
  per submission — so a line matching both scopes produces one alert per
  scope, never two from the same rule.
- Webhook payload includes `scope: "device"` or `scope: "global"` so you
  can tell them apart downstream.

**Alert rules UI: per-device / fleet-wide tabs.** The Logs page now has
a tab switcher above the rules table. "+ Add rule" opens a modal that
adapts to the active tab — fleet-wide mode hides the device picker and
shows a hint about the `*` wildcard.

### Changed

- Live tail polling interval: 10s → **30s**. Always-on now — the
  pause-on-scroll-up behaviour and PAUSED badge are removed. If you want to
  read older lines, uncheck "auto-scroll to newest".
- `handle_log_submit` dedupes alerts within a submission by
  `(scope, unit, pattern)` — previously the same rule could fire multiple
  times if matched lines came in across multiple units.
- All version strings bumped to 1.8.2.

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/logs/rules/global` | List fleet-wide rules |
| POST   | `/api/logs/rules/global` | Create fleet-wide rule |
| DELETE | `/api/logs/rules/global/{id}` | Remove fleet-wide rule |

### Tests

15 new tests in `tests/test_v182.py` — validation (7 cases covering wildcard,
specific units, bad regex, bad units, threshold bounds, empty fields),
empty-array preservation (quiet vs chatty units, mixed submissions),
wildcard matching, and dedupe-key semantics. Full suite:
**123 passing, 0 failing** (1 pre-existing skip).

### Notes

- **All v1.8.1 agents should update** to pick up the empty-submission fix.
  A v1.8.1 agent with a quiet watched unit will still not appear on the
  Logs page even after upgrading the server.
- Fleet-wide rules are capped at 50 per server (`MAX_GLOBAL_LOG_RULES`).
  That's a safety fence, not a target — most deployments need 2-5.
- No changes to data files; `log_rules_global.json` is created on first
  write. Existing `log_watch` rules on device records continue to work
  unchanged.

---

## v1.8.1 — 2026-04-24

### Added

**Dedicated "Logs" page in the sidebar.** The v1.8.0 log-tail feature was
only surfaced inside the per-service drill-down, which was too buried and
had no UI for configuring alert rules (you had to curl the API). This
release makes logs a first-class page.

The new page has three stacked widgets:

- **Search bar** — hits `/api/logs/search` with case-insensitive regex.
  Results grouped by device (collapsible), timestamped, and color-coded
  by severity pattern (FATAL/ERROR/WARN detected automatically).
- **Live tail** — the default view when no search is active. Polls
  `/api/logs/tail` every 10 seconds using a monotonically-advancing
  `since=` cursor; pauses auto-scroll when the user scrolls up
  (shows a "PAUSED" badge), resumes when they scroll back to the bottom.
  Device and unit filter dropdowns narrow the stream.
- **Alert rules table** — cross-fleet view of all `log_watch` rules,
  with an "+ Add rule" button that opens a proper form (device picker,
  unit, regex pattern, threshold). Adding a rule automatically ensures
  the target unit is in `services_watched` so the agent actually
  submits its logs.

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/logs/tail?since=<ts>&device=<id>&unit=<n>` | Incremental fetch for the live-tail page |
| GET    | `/api/logs/rules` | Cross-fleet aggregate of all log_watch rules |

### Fixed

- Service drill-down now **always shows** "State history" and "Recent logs"
  sections even when empty, with explanatory text. Previously the sections
  were silently omitted if the device hadn't submitted logs yet, making it
  look like the feature was broken. ([reported after v1.8.0 ship])
- Empty-state messaging includes the diagnostic hints: agent needs v1.8.0+
  and journalctl access, and logs are submitted every ~5 min so a freshly
  configured unit takes a poll or two before anything shows up.

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.8.1
- "Recent logs" section now auto-expands by default when it has content
  (same for State history) — one fewer click to get to what you opened
  the modal for

### Tests

- Added `tests/test_v181.py` — 7 new tests covering log rules aggregation,
  log tail filtering (since/device), device config round-trip, and version
  bump. Full suite: **108 passing, 0 failing** (1 pre-existing skip).

### Notes

- No agent changes in 1.8.1 — everything is server-side plus UI. v1.8.0
  agents work unchanged with a v1.8.1 server.
- The live tail uses client-side polling, not WebSockets or SSE. A
  genuine push channel would need persistent connection state in the CGI
  model, which doesn't fit. 10-second polling is cheap and survives server
  restarts invisibly.
- Alert rules editor is per-device. A fleet-wide "apply to all devices
  matching this unit" mode is on the roadmap for v1.9.

---

## v1.8.0 — 2026-04-23

### Added

**Service monitoring** — agent reports watched systemd units on each heartbeat.
Per-device `services_watched` list (e.g. `nginx.service`, `postgresql.service`).
Server tracks state, records transitions, fires webhooks.

- Agent calls `systemctl show` per watched unit; reports `ActiveState`,
  `SubState`, and `ActiveEnterTimestamp` on every poll
- Server records state transitions in `service_history.json` (last 100 per
  unit). New webhook events `service_down` (priority 4) and `service_up`
  (priority 3) fire on transitions, with `red_circle,gear` / `green_circle,gear`
  tags
- New "Services" page in the dashboard — fleet matrix with up/down counts,
  per-device drill-down showing state history, recent logs per unit, and
  inline configuration
- New Prometheus metrics: `remotepower_service_active{device,name,group,unit,sub}`
  (1/0 per unit) and `remotepower_services_down_total{device,name,group}`
- Config is pushed from server to agent via heartbeat response — no agent
  restart required to change watched units
- New config key `service_webhook_enabled` (default `true`)

**Log tail + pattern alerts** — agent submits recent journal lines per watched
unit; server keeps a rolling buffer and can fire webhooks on regex matches.

- Agent calls `journalctl -u <unit> --since` every 5 polls (~5 min) and
  submits via new `/api/logs` endpoint
- Server stores per-device, per-unit rolling buffer — bounded at 6 hours,
  2 MB per device
- Per-device `log_watch` rules `[{unit, pattern, threshold}]` — regex matches
  trigger `log_alert` webhooks (priority 4, `warning,scroll` tags)
- New `/api/logs/search?q=<regex>&device=<id>` endpoint — cross-device grep
  over the rolling buffer. No indexing, just regex scan; deliberately not a
  full log analytics stack
- Captured logs appear inline in the per-device service drill-down so you
  can see *why* a service went red without SSH-ing in

**Maintenance windows** — suppress webhook alerts during scheduled windows,
with audit trail.

- Per-device, per-group, or fleet-global scope
- One-shot (`start` + `end` ISO-8601) or recurring (`cron` + `duration` seconds)
- Optional per-window event allowlist — e.g. suppress only `patch_alert`,
  leave `device_offline` still firing
- `in_maintenance(event, payload)` helper wraps every `fire_webhook()` call
  — suppresses transparently, records audit entry in `maint_suppressed.json`
- Built-in lightweight cron evaluator supports `*`, `*/N`, `a,b,c`, and
  single integers across all 5 fields
- New Prometheus metric: `remotepower_maintenance_windows_active`
- New "Maintenance" page with full lifecycle UI — create/list/delete
  windows, view suppression audit trail

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/services` | Fleet-wide service state |
| GET    | `/api/devices/{id}/services` | Per-device with state history + log tails |
| GET    | `/api/devices/{id}/services/config` | Read watched units + log rules |
| POST   | `/api/devices/{id}/services/config` | Set watched units + log rules |
| POST   | `/api/logs` | Agent submits per-unit journal lines |
| GET    | `/api/logs/search?q=<regex>` | Cross-device log search |
| GET    | `/api/devices/{id}/logs` | Full captured buffer for one device |
| GET    | `/api/maintenance` | List all windows + active flag |
| POST   | `/api/maintenance` | Create a window |
| DELETE | `/api/maintenance/{id}` | Remove a window |
| GET    | `/api/maintenance/suppressions` | Audit trail of suppressed webhooks |

### New data files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `services.json` | Current service state per device |
| `service_history.json` | State transition log per (device, unit) |
| `log_watch.json` | Rolling log buffer per device + unit |
| `maintenance.json` | Defined windows |
| `maint_suppressed.json` | Audit trail of suppressed webhook events |

### Agent changes (Linux)

- `VERSION = '1.8.0'`
- New functions: `get_services()`, `_parse_systemd_timestamp()`,
  `get_unit_logs()`, `submit_unit_logs()`
- New constants: `SERVICE_CHECK_EVERY = 1` (every poll — cheap),
  `LOG_SUBMIT_EVERY = 5` (every 5 min), `LOG_LOOKBACK_SECONDS = 360`,
  `MAX_LOG_LINES_PER_UNIT = 100`
- Heartbeat loop now reads `services_watched` and `log_watch` from server
  responses — server-driven configuration means no agent restart when you
  change what a device is monitoring

### Webhook events extended

- New events: `service_down`, `service_up`, `log_alert`
- All existing webhook types (Discord / Slack / ntfy / gotify / generic)
  now render these with appropriate titles, priorities, and tags

### Cleanup

- Fixed 4 pre-existing test failures in `tests/test_api.py` for
  `verify_token()` — tests were written for an older `str`-returning
  signature; function has returned `(username, role)` since v1.6.x
- Cleaned up residual comment fragment on `MAX_BODY_BYTES` from v1.7.0
  buffer bump
- Removed a small duplicate in `_cron_match()` introduced during v1.8.0
  authoring

### Notes

- Service monitoring requires `systemctl` — agent silently skips reporting
  on non-systemd hosts
- The log tail deliberately does not do indexing, retention policies, or
  structured parsing. It's a rolling buffer with regex search. If you need
  Loki or Graylog, run those
- Maintenance windows only suppress *webhooks* — the events themselves are
  still recorded in uptime history, monitor history, etc. You're not losing
  visibility, just quiet on the push channel
- Cron evaluator supports the common subset (`*`, `*/N`, lists, literals).
  Ranges like `1-5` and named days like `MON` are not supported — use
  explicit lists instead (e.g. `1,2,3,4,5`)

## v1.7.0 — 2026-04-23

### Added

**CVE Scanner** — automatic vulnerability scanning against installed packages
using the free [OSV.dev](https://osv.dev) database. No API key required.

- New agent function `get_package_list()` enumerates installed packages via
  `dpkg-query` / `rpm` / `pacman` / `apk`. Submitted to the server every 6
  hours (or whenever the package set changes) via a new `/api/packages`
  endpoint. Hash-gated — resubmits only when the list actually changes.
- New server module `cve_scanner.py` queries OSV's `/v1/querybatch` (up to
  500 packages per request) and hydrates vulnerability details on first
  encounter. Details cached for 7 days in `cve_details_cache.json`.
- Severity normalized to `critical` / `high` / `medium` / `low` / `unknown`
  from ecosystem-specific labels (Debian/RedHat style) with CVSS base-score
  fallback.
- New "CVEs" page in the dashboard: aggregate severity counts across the
  fleet, per-device breakdown, per-vulnerability drill-down with links to
  upstream advisories and fixed-version information when available.
- Ignore list: mark a CVE as accepted risk either globally or for a specific
  device. Ignored entries are excluded from counts and webhook alerts but
  remain visible (dimmed) in the per-device view.
- New webhook event `cve_found` fires when new critical/high vulnerabilities
  appear in a scan that weren't present in the previous scan (respects the
  ignore list). Priority 5 (urgent) with `rotating_light,shield` tags.
- Supported ecosystems: Debian, Ubuntu, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Red Hat,
  Alpine, Arch Linux. Fedora is not reliably covered by OSV and is flagged
  as `unsupported`.
- New config key `cve_webhook_enabled` (default `true`).

**Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint** — standard text exposition at
`GET /api/metrics`, authenticated via session token or API key. Prometheus's
native `bearer_token` scrape config works unchanged.

Metric families exposed:
- `remotepower_info{version}` — server version
- `remotepower_devices_total` / `remotepower_devices_online`
- `remotepower_device_online{device,name,group,os}` — 1/0 per device
- `remotepower_device_last_seen_timestamp_seconds{...}`
- `remotepower_device_cpu_percent{...}` / `_mem_percent{...}` / `_disk_percent{...}`
- `remotepower_device_upgradable_packages{...,manager}`
- `remotepower_device_cve_findings{...,severity}`
- `remotepower_monitor_up{label,type,target}`
- `remotepower_monitor_last_check_timestamp_seconds{...}`
- `remotepower_commands_pending_total`
- `remotepower_scheduled_jobs_total`
- `remotepower_webhook_deliveries_total{status}`
- `remotepower_webhook_log_size`

### New endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST   | `/api/packages` | Agent submits installed package list (device-auth) |
| POST   | `/api/cve/scan` | Admin triggers CVE scan for one or all devices |
| GET    | `/api/cve/findings` | Aggregate CVE report across all devices |
| GET    | `/api/devices/{id}/cve` | Per-device CVE findings |
| GET    | `/api/cve/ignore` | List all active ignore entries |
| POST   | `/api/cve/ignore` | Mark a CVE as accepted risk |
| DELETE | `/api/cve/ignore/{vuln_id}` | Remove an ignore |
| GET    | `/api/metrics` | Prometheus scrape endpoint |

### New data files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `packages.json` | Per-device installed package list + hash + collected timestamp |
| `cve_findings.json` | Per-device scan results |
| `cve_ignore.json` | Global/per-device CVE ignore list |
| `cve_details_cache.json` | OSV vulnerability detail cache (7-day TTL) |

### Agent changes

- Bumped agent version to 1.7.0 (Linux + Windows)
- New constants: `PACKAGE_LIST_EVERY = 360`, `MAX_PACKAGES_SEND = 10000`
- New functions (Linux): `get_os_release()`, `get_package_list()`,
  `send_package_list()` + three hash-cache helpers
- New sidecar file `/etc/remotepower/pkg_hash` stores the hash of the last
  submitted package list so subsequent polls can skip resubmission when
  nothing changed
- Windows agent gets the version bump but no package enumeration (OSV
  doesn't cover Windows app ecosystems well; Windows devices show as
  `unsupported` in the CVE UI)

### Changed

- All version strings bumped to 1.7.0
- `_webhook_message()`, `_webhook_priority()`, `_webhook_tags()` extended
  for the new `cve_found` event
- `GET /api/config` now returns `cve_webhook_enabled`
- `POST /api/config` accepts `cve_webhook_enabled` (bool)
- DELETE guard on `/api/devices/<id>` updated to exclude the new `/cve`
  subresource path

---

## v1.6.3 — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Bulk "Upgrade packages" rejected freshly-restarted devices with
  `Unknown or unreported package manager: none`. Root cause: the server
  looked up `sysinfo.packages.manager` on the device record, but `packages`
  is only populated after a patch-info poll — which runs every `PATCH_EVERY`
  (180) polls, i.e. roughly 3 hours after agent restart. On any device that
  had been restarted recently (every Debian box the 1.6.1 service-file fix
  was deployed to) the upgrade button was effectively broken.

  The dispatcher no longer relies on server-side sysinfo at all. It now
  queues a single self-detecting shell snippet that runs `command -v
  apt-get` / `dnf` / `pacman` on the device at execution time and picks
  the right one. This also simplifies the server code — one command, no
  per-device dispatch, no stale-cache failure modes.

### Changed
- `POST /api/upgrade-device` response no longer includes the `manager`
  field (the server doesn't know in advance anymore). The queued exec
  output — visible on the next heartbeat — still shows which manager ran.
- All version strings bumped to 1.6.3.

### Note on custom `apt` commands
The Custom Command dialog runs whatever string you type verbatim. If you
manually type `apt update && apt upgrade -y …` on a box that still has
`NoNewPrivileges=yes` in its agent service file, you'll still see the
`seteuid 105 failed` error — that's expected, and the fix is to deploy
the 1.6.1 service file and do `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl
restart remotepower-agent` on that host. The bulk "Upgrade packages"
button works around this automatically via the APT_CONFIG override;
custom commands don't, by design.
---
 
## v1.6.2 — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Bulk "Upgrade packages" still failed on Debian/Ubuntu with
  `E: seteuid 105 failed - seteuid (1: Operation not permitted)` because the
  `-o APT::Sandbox::User=root` flag was only applied to `apt-get upgrade`.
  But `apt-get update` is the call that actually opens network sockets and
  drops to the `_apt` user — so under systemd hardening (`NoNewPrivileges=yes`,
  restricted cgroups, user namespaces), `apt-get update` returned rc=100 and
  short-circuited the `&&` chain before upgrade ever ran.

  The fix writes a one-line apt config to a tempfile, points `APT_CONFIG` at
  it, and exports that env var for the whole chain. Every `apt-get` call in
  the chain (`update`, `upgrade`, `autoremove`, `clean`) now inherits
  `APT::Sandbox::User "root"` plus the `Dpkg::Options` conffile handling, and
  a `trap` cleans up the tempfile even if any step fails.

  **Server-only fix** — agents don't need to be restarted to pick this up,
  since the command is constructed server-side and dispatched via the
  existing `exec:` channel. Just redeploy the server.

### Changed
- All version strings bumped to 1.6.2.
---
 
## v1.6.1 — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- Bulk-action icons in the selection bar rendered as oversized default-styled
  buttons — `.btn-shutdown` and `.btn-reboot` had no CSS defined, so SVGs were
  unconstrained. Added matching red/amber/purple button styles with proper 14px
  SVG sizing so the batch bar visually matches the rest of the UI.
- Device "…" dropdown menu was pierced by sibling cards' menu buttons due to
  each `.device-card` sharing a stacking context with `z-index: 20`. The open
  dropdown's parent card is now lifted via `:has(.device-dropdown.active)` plus
  an explicit `z-index: 9999` on the active dropdown wrapper as a fallback.
- Agent `exec:` commands running apt failed with
  `seteuid 105 failed - seteuid (1: Operation not permitted)` because
  `NoNewPrivileges=yes` in `remotepower-agent.service` blocked apt's drop to
  the `_apt` user. Removed the directive — the agent runs as root by design,
  so this hardening was cosmetic. Defence-in-depth added in the new upgrade
  path via `-o APT::Sandbox::User=root`.

### New features
- Bulk "Upgrade packages" action — select multiple devices and run apt/dnf/
  pacman upgrade across all of them in one click. Server dispatches the right
  command per device based on the package manager reported in sysinfo:
  - apt:    `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get autoremove -y && apt-get clean`
            (with `APT::Sandbox::User=root` and non-interactive dpkg conffile handling)
  - dnf:    `dnf -y upgrade`
  - pacman: `pacman -Syu --noconfirm`
  Output arrives on the next heartbeat (~60s) via the existing `exec:` pipe.
- "Update all" button renamed to "Update agent" with a clarifying tooltip so
  it isn't confused with package upgrades.

### New API
- `POST /api/upgrade-device` — body `{device_ids: [...]}` or `{device_id: "..."}`.
  Returns per-device results including the detected package manager, or an
  error if the manager is unknown/unreported.

### Changed
- All version strings bumped to 1.6.1.
