# RemotePower documentation

The main `README.md` at the repo root is the place to start. This folder
holds long-form docs that don't fit there.

## Getting started

- **[install.md](install.md)** — Server install (Linux + Docker), client
 enrolment, optional webterm, demo vhost.
- **[requirements.md](requirements.md)** — Minimum/recommended server
 hardware (cores, RAM, disk) by fleet size, plus agent/client footprint.
- **[admin-guide.md](admin-guide.md)** — Full install & operations guide:
 hardening, daily ops, backup/restore, upgrades, troubleshooting.
- **[features.md](features.md)** — Full feature inventory and the
 per-feature guide.
- **[writing-a-connector.md](writing-a-connector.md)** — Write your own
 integration connector plugin (drop-in `connectors.d/*.py`).
- **[cookbook.md](cookbook.md)** — Task-shaped recipes: "I want to do X — here
 are the steps" (monitor a host, 3-2-1 backups, tame alert noise, roll out
 safely, …).
- **[architecture.md](architecture.md)** — How the pieces fit together,
 the heartbeat → command → response cycle, file layout on disk.
- **[internals.md](internals.md)** — Under the hood: the engineering tour of
 *how it's built* — the table-driven router, the one-API/three-backend storage
 layer, the maintenance sweeps, request validation, the no-build frontend, and
 the defensive-security posture. For the curious and for contributors.
- **[deployment.md](deployment.md)** — Install-everything map: server, agents
 (Linux/Windows/macOS), satellites, app nodes, load balancer, Postgres/HA —
 which script installs each and when you need it.
- **[scaling.md](scaling.md)** — Running large fleets (1000+ agents): the
 PostgreSQL backend, poll-interval tuning, the gunicorn worker pool, load-balanced
 multi-node, relay satellites, PgBouncer, retention, and the encryption matrix.
- **[satellites.md](satellites.md)** — Relay satellites for segmented networks:
 add one, encrypt the agent→satellite hop, point agents at it, revoke.
- **[push.md](push.md)** — Experimental opt-in agent push channel: near-
 instant command dispatch via a companion WebSocket daemon, off by default.
- **[upgrading.md](upgrading.md)** — One command (`install.sh update`) for
 every upgrade, self-detecting whether that's a plain code update or a
 pre-6.1.0 CGI/SCGI-to-gunicorn/Flask conversion.
- **[troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md)** — Common issues and
 diagnostics.

## Reference

- **[api.md](api.md)** — REST endpoints + auth model. Interactive at
 `/swagger.html`; spec at `/api/openapi.json`.
- **[agent-commands.md](agent-commands.md)** — CLI for the Linux agent.
- **[fleet-management.md](fleet-management.md)** — operating the fleet from the
 dashboard: agent updates, release signing, the command queue, install/uninstall,
 reboot/WoL, quarantine, SLA targets, OpenSCAP, and AI Investigate.
- **[windows-client.md](windows-client.md)** — Windows-specific notes,
 install path, service control.
- **[https.md](https.md)** — TLS termination at nginx with acme.sh or
 Let's Encrypt.
- **[security.md](security.md)** — Security controls and on-disk data layout.
- **[threat-model.md](threat-model.md)** — Structured STRIDE threat/mitigation
 matrix, organized by attacker goal rather than by feature.
- **[security-review-6.2.3.md](security-review-6.2.3.md)** — Latest review: the
 v6.2.3 "Un1fyMatters" pass — full SAST stack (CodeQL 0 results, Bandit 0 new,
 gitleaks clean, Semgrep triaged) plus an exhaustive six-dimension adversarial
 audit prompted by the release's shared-helper refactors. Confirmed the config-
 secret, HTML-escaping and request-validation refactors are behaviour-preserving
 (a 20k-config property test on the secret redactors), and fixed a set of
 pre-existing multi-tenant isolation gaps (cross-tenant device targeting and
 fleet-aggregate read leaks) plus a drift between the off-box export surfaces'
 secret-redaction lists; no Critical/High/Medium ships.
- **[security-review-6.2.2.md](security-review-6.2.2.md)** — the
 v6.2.2 "Pu1seMatters" pass — full SAST stack (Bandit 0 new, gitleaks clean,
 agents F821-clean) plus a Semgrep pass with every finding triaged in the open, a
 trust-boundary review of the new delta-heartbeat protocol (per-device,
 whitelisted, capability-negotiated — no stale or cross-device exposure) and the
 reused HTTPS transport (same cert/mTLS verification, redirects still refused), and
 a live header/auth-boundary check of production. One agent-side hardening (a
 billion-laughs guard on the OpenSCAP XML parse) was made from the scan; no
 Critical/High/Medium ships.
- **[security-review-6.2.0.md](security-review-6.2.0.md)** — the v6.2.0
 "Daem0nMatters" pass — full SAST stack (CodeQL 0 results, Bandit 0 High,
 gitleaks clean) plus an authorization audit of the new attack surface (the
 supervised-service installers, governed AI executor, PII scan, EDR coverage,
 DNS-blocker control, JIT vault checkout) and a prompt-injection analysis of the AI
 executor (which cannot author commands — it may only pick a saved catalog action
 by exact id); no Critical/High/Medium ships.
## Release notes

The full release history — every version, newest first — lives in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) at the repository root.

The three most recent per-release notes are kept here:

- **[v6.3.0.md](v6.3.0.md)** — "Fl0wMatters": the first wave of a UX program —
 undo toasts instead of confirm dialogs for low-risk deletes (deferred commit),
 optimistic alert ack/resolve with a real un-ack Undo, "N of M shown" + Clear
 chips on filtered tables, Retry buttons on failed loads, an unsaved-changes
 guard on Settings, and bulk resolve/assign on Tickets.
- **[v6.2.3.md](v6.2.3.md)** — "Un1fyMatters": a consolidation and tidy-up pass —
 an optional listen port on Create tunnel, an ACME page that loads on navigation,
 clearer empty-snapshot feedback, and a removed duplicate dampening setting; plus
 a project-wide sweep that collapsed repeated code idioms, deleted dead code and
 de-duplicated the docs.
- **[v6.2.2.md](v6.2.2.md)** — "Pu1seMatters": performance and polish around
 the heartbeat — delta sysinfo (agents skip re-sending unchanged inventory),
 agent HTTP keep-alive, streamed large-fleet tables and a leaner first load;
 an always-on kernel-module visibility check that flags the v6.2.1 failure
 class before patch day; an upgrade-in-place installer; keyboard-driven alert
 inbox, device hover cards and tab-level device deep links.
Older release notes (v6.1.2 and earlier) live in
[CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).
